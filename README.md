# AutoML_CNN_Thesis
Respository for the code used for my thesis on the comparison of Automated Machine Learning performance against Convolutional Neural Networks in facial emotional recognition.
Autokeras was used as the AutoML algorithm, and Resnet50, InceptionV3 and VGG16 were the CNN architectures that were compared against it on a dataset.
The code and outputs of each model are listed in this repository.
The trained versions of these models can be found through the following link: (link here)
